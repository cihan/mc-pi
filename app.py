# assume that our r is 1
#generate a random float for x in 0,1

#generate a random float for y in 0,1

#calculate the hypotenuse

#if hypotenuse is equal or less than 1 it means dart hitting shaded area 


#if not do nothing.

#get sum of tries (all)

#calculate pi with formula ======> pi = 4* (shaded hits)/tries
